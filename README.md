# ADB.NET
This is intended to be used as a DLL to accompany programs that can perform operations on Android devices and provide, a safe and reliable communication interface using TCP to connect to the ADB daemon instead of running a shell for each command, and redirecting output.

This code is poorly documented and has not been tested enough to be used in bigger projects. There is also very limited functionality to it. This is just a proof of concept. I wouldn't use this code if I was you. Good luck!
